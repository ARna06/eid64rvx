# UMBRA

This project is a uses RISCV as an embedded scripting language in eidolon (my game engine project). While testing, I realized I should run Linux as a basic test for the emulator.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement JIT.
- [ ] Make memory access a lot faster (needs a major overhaul).
- [ ] Implement more syscalls.
- [ ] Write documentation.
